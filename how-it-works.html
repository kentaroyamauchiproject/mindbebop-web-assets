<h1>How it works</h1>
<p class="subtle">A quiet overview of the MINDBEBOP mind-brushing kit.</p>

<!-- Mind brushing -->
<h2>What we mean by “mind brushing”</h2>

<p>
Mind brushing is the habit of gently clearing thoughts
that don’t need to stay active in your head.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the day, thoughts leave residue —
repeated worries, unfinished judgments,
reminders you don’t want to forget,
and background noise that keeps the mind alert
even when nothing is required.
Over time, this buildup creates thought friction.
</p>

<p>
Mind brushing isn’t about <strong>fixing thoughts or controlling anything</strong>.
It’s about giving a thought a place to land,
a response when needed,
or enough quiet to let it end on its own —
so it doesn’t have to be carried.
</p>
<hr class="rule">

<h2>Different thoughts need different kinds of care</h2>

<p>
Some thoughts need an answer.<br>
Some need to be trusted and set aside.<br>
Some need quiet so they can lose urgency on their own.<br>
Some belong to the past or the future and don’t need to stay in now.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind MINDBEBOP is to meet thoughts
<strong>right when they show up</strong> —
right when they begin creating thought friction —
rather than later as a review or reflection.
</p>

<p>
This is why the tools are designed to be ultralight
and used in the moment,
whenever a thought starts pulling on attention.
</p>
<hr class="rule">

<h2>Two ways thoughts ask for care</h2>

<p>
When a thought keeps returning,
it’s usually for one of two reasons.
</p>

<p>
Either it needs a response —
or it needs to be carried
so you don’t have to hold it right now.
</p>

<p>
MINDBEBOP supports both.
</p>

<h3>Response Mode</h3>
<p><strong>When a thought needs an answer.</strong></p>

<p>
Some thoughts keep looping because the mind hasn’t received a response.
They aren’t asking to be remembered or managed —
they’re asking to be handled.
</p>

<p>
Responding once lets the brain register:
<em>“This has been dealt with.”</em>
After that, the thought often loses its urgency.
</p>

<h3>Carry Mode</h3>
<p><strong>When a thought feels important, but too heavy to carry.</strong></p>

<p>
Some thoughts don’t need an answer.
They stay active because you’re afraid of losing them —
an idea, a reminder, or something meaningful.
</p>

<p>
Carry Mode lets the system hold the thought for you,
so your mind can let go <strong>without fear of losing it</strong>.
</p>

<hr class="rule">
<p class="subtle">
These two modes show up across the system — each app supports one or both in its own way.
</p>
<p class="subtle">
You don’t need to choose a mode — you just notice what the thought is asking for.
</p>

<!--
<h2>How distance reduces thought friction</h2>

<p>
Thought friction isn’t caused by thoughts themselves —
it’s caused by how close they sit to attention.
</p>

<p>
MINDBEBOP reduces friction by creating distance between
a thought and the mind that’s carrying it.
</p>

<p>
Each tool creates a different scale of distance.
</p>

<ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; margin-top:24px;">
  <li style="margin-bottom:16px;">
    <strong>MindFlipOut</strong><br>
    <span class="subtle">
      Creates <strong>1 inch of distance</strong> — enough to stop the spin
      by responding once.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom:16px;">
    <strong>MindShoutOut</strong><br>
    <span class="subtle">
      Creates <strong>1 mile of distance</strong> — the weight is moved
      out of your head without being lost.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom:16px;">
    <strong>MindZoneOut</strong><br>
    <span class="subtle">
      Creates <strong>infinite distance</strong> — the thought is no longer
      held, only observed.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="subtle">
Distance doesn’t solve thoughts.
It lets them stop demanding attention.
</p>

<h2>How the apps support these modes</h2>

<!-- MindFlipOut -->
<div class="app-title">
  <img
    src="/image/MB_MFO_Icon_1024-rounded.png"
    data-dark="/image/MB_MFO_Icon_1024_INV-rounded.png"
    alt="MindFlipOut icon">
  <h3>MindFlipOut</h3>
</div>

<p><strong>Primary support for Response Mode.</strong></p>

<p>
MindFlipOut helps when a thought needs an answer.
Writing it down and responding once
gives the thought a place to land,
so it doesn’t keep circling.
</p>

<!-- MindShoutOut -->
<div class="app-title">
  <img
    src="/image/MB_MSO_Icon_1024-rounded.png"
    data-dark="/image/MB_MSO_Icon_1024_INV-rounded.png"
    alt="MindShoutOut icon">
  <h3>MindShoutOut</h3>
</div>

<p><strong>Primary support for Carry Mode.</strong></p>

<p>
MindShoutOut helps when a thought matters
but holding it creates friction.
Scheduling it lets the system carry the weight —
without losing the thought.
</p>

<!-- MindZoneOut -->
<div class="app-title">
  <img
    src="/image/MB_MZO_Icon_1024-rounded.png"
    data-dark="/image/MB_MZO_Icon_1024_INV-rounded.png"
    alt="MindZoneOut icon">
  <h3>MindZoneOut</h3>
</div>

<p><strong>A quiet space where thoughts can settle.</strong></p>

<p>
MindZoneOut reduces signals and stimulation,
giving thoughts room to soften
or reach their own stopping point —
whether they came from Response Mode or Carry Mode.
</p>
<p class="subtle">
MindZoneOut doesn’t decide what a thought means — it simply gives it space.
</p>

<!-- MindEaseOut -->
<div class="app-title">
  <img
    src="/image/MB_MEO_Icon_1024-rounded.png"
    data-dark="/image/MB_MEO_Icon_1024_INV-rounded.png"
    alt="MindEaseOut icon">
  <h3>Time-based release</h3>
</div>

<p><strong>When a thought belongs to a different time.</strong></p>

<p>
Some thoughts are about the past.
Others are about the future.
When a thought doesn’t belong in the present,
acknowledging it by time
can be enough to let it ease out —
without fixing, reframing, or holding on.
</p>

<!-- MindBackOut -->
<div class="app-title">
  <img
    src="/image/MB_MBO_Icon_1024-rounded.png"
    data-dark="/image/MB_MBO_Icon_1024_INV-rounded.png"
    alt="MindBackOut icon">
  <h3>MindBackOut</h3>
</div>

<p><strong>When it’s not a thought — it’s the role.</strong></p>

<p>
Some mental friction doesn’t come from a specific thought.
It comes from staying inside a role for too long —
a worker, a caretaker, a problem-solver,
a version of yourself that never fully steps aside.
</p>

<p>
MindBackOut offers a quiet way to step out of the role itself,
even briefly.
It doesn’t ask you to respond, carry, fix, or track anything.
</p>

<p>
By creating distance from the role,
fewer thoughts need Response Mode or Carry Mode at all.
</p>

<hr class="rule">

<p class="subtle">
MINDBEBOP tools are designed to disappear once they’ve done their job.
The goal isn’t to keep thoughts active —
it’s to help them come to an end.
