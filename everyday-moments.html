<h1>Everyday moments</h1>

<p>
MINDBEBOP apps aren’t meant to be used in a specific way.<br>
They’re meant to be there when a thought comes up.
</p>

<p class="subtle">
Not routines. Not techniques. Just moments.
</p>

<!-- NIGHT / QUIET -->

<div class="section">
<h2>Late at night</h2>
<p>
A student is lying in bed, replaying the same sentence over and over.
</p>
<p>
They open <strong>MindFlipOut</strong>, write one response to the thought, and close the app.
The thought doesn’t disappear — it simply stops spinning.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Waking up too early</h2>
<p>
A future-oriented worry arrives before the body is ready.
</p>
<p>
They open <strong>MindEaseOut</strong>, acknowledge the thought as belonging to the future,
and let it be released by time.
Sleep returns.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Half-asleep</h2>
<p>
A fragment of a thought surfaces — not even a full sentence yet.
</p>
<p>
They place it into <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> without completing it.
Morning can carry it, or not.
</p>
</div>

<!-- MORNING / TRANSITIONS -->

<div class="section">
<h2>While brushing teeth</h2>
<p>
A reminder appears briefly on the lock screen.
</p>
<p>
It comes from <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> — not advice, just a sentence they trusted earlier.
They acknowledge it and continue brushing.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Standing in the shower</h2>
<p>
A thought arrives fully formed and uninvited.
</p>
<p>
They don’t respond yet.
Knowing they can place it into <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> later
keeps it from sticking.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>On the way out the door</h2>
<p>
A reminder arrives at the edge of the day.
</p>
<p>
It’s a <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> notification.
They acknowledge it without acting on it and leave anyway.
</p>
</div>

<!-- WORK / DAYTIME -->

<div class="section">
<h2>Between meetings</h2>
<p>
A work thought feels too heavy to hold between calls.
</p>
<p>
They place it into <strong>MindShoutOut</strong>.
The next meeting begins without the thought tagging along.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Before opening email</h2>
<p>
A familiar tension shows up before the inbox does.
</p>
<p>
They open <strong>MindFlipOut</strong> and respond to the tension itself,
not the messages.
Email can wait.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Mid-afternoon fatigue</h2>
<p>
Nothing is wrong — everything just feels loud.
</p>
<p>
They open <strong>MindZoneOut</strong>.
A quiet screen appears.
A previously saved thought fades in softly.
Nothing needs action. The noise drops.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>During repetitive work</h2>
<p>
The task itself is simple, but attention keeps slipping away halfway through.
</p>
<p>
A short reminder repeats quietly from <strong>MindShoutOut</strong>.
Not encouragement — just presence.
The work continues without needing to be watched.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>After finishing a task</h2>
<p>
The body relaxes, but the mind keeps holding on.
</p>
<p>
They open <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> and place the lingering thought there,
so the pause can actually be a pause.
</p>
</div>

<!-- SOCIAL / EMOTIONAL -->

<div class="section">
<h2>After an argument</h2>
<p>
A sentence keeps replaying.
</p>
<p>
They write one response in <strong>MindFlipOut</strong> — not the perfect one, just enough.
Later, they schedule it in <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> to revisit when emotions cool.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Before sending a message</h2>
<p>
A draft sits unsent.
</p>
<p>
Instead of replying, they open <strong>MindFlipOut</strong>
and respond to the thought behind the message.
The phone goes back into a pocket.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>After receiving news</h2>
<p>
A reaction arrives faster than clarity.
</p>
<p>
They place the reaction into <strong>MindShoutOut</strong>
without interpreting it yet.
</p>
</div>

<!-- MOVEMENT / SPACE -->

<div class="section">
<h2>On public transport</h2>
<p>
They open <strong>MindZoneOut</strong> for less than a minute.
</p>
<p>
A thought appears on the wall, then fades.
Nothing is solved — but the body softens.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>During a walk</h2>
<p>
A thought feels meaningful but unfinished.
</p>
<p>
They place it into <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> so it doesn’t need to be carried.
The walk becomes just a walk again.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Sitting in a café</h2>
<p>
Ambient noise replaces internal noise.
</p>
<p>
They glance at <strong>MindZoneOut</strong>.
A reminder appears once, quietly, then leaves.
Coffee stays warm.
</p>
</div>

<!-- EVENING / CLOSING -->

<div class="section">
<h2>At the end of the day</h2>
<p>
A few thoughts remain unfinished.
</p>
<p>
One is answered in <strong>MindFlipOut</strong>.<br>
One is set aside in <strong>MindShoutOut</strong>.<br>
One is left quietly in <strong>MindZoneOut</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Nothing needs closure tonight.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Late-night cravings</h2>
<p>
A desire for fast food appears suddenly, louder than hunger.
</p>
<p>
They place the craving into <strong>MindZoneOut</strong>.
Without arguing with it, the intensity shifts.
Sometimes the craving passes. Sometimes it doesn’t.
Either way, it no longer demands an answer.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Before sleep</h2>
<p>
A thought insists on being held.
</p>
<p>
They place it into <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> —
not to forget it,
but to stop gripping it.
</p>
</div>

<!-- ROLE / IDENTITY -->

<div class="section">
<h2>When it’s not a thought</h2>
<p>
Pressure doesn’t come from words —
it comes from a role that hasn’t been taken off.
</p>
<p>
They open <strong>MindBackOut</strong> briefly.
When they return, fewer thoughts need attention at all.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>After a long day of being “on”</h2>
<p>
Nothing specific is wrong.
</p>
<p>
They step into <strong>MindBackOut</strong> to exit the role itself.
The evening feels lighter.
</p>
</div>

<!-- USAGE PATTERNS -->

<div class="section">
<h2>Using just one app</h2>
<p class="subtle">
Some people only use one tool.
</p>
<p>
They use <strong>MindFlipOut</strong> to respond and move on.<br>
Or <strong>MindShoutOut</strong> to carry important thoughts.<br>
Or <strong>MindZoneOut</strong> to let the system settle itself.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Using several, lightly</h2>
<p class="subtle">
Others let the apps support each other.
</p>
<p>
A thought is answered in <strong>MindFlipOut</strong>,<br>
carried by <strong>MindShoutOut</strong>,<br>
and seen quietly in <strong>MindZoneOut</strong>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>
None of these are instructions.<br>
They’re examples of what can happen when thoughts are met
<strong>as they appear</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Small moments.<br>
Little distance.<br>
Less to carry.
</p>
</div>
