<h1>Everyday moments</h1>

<p>
    MINDBEBOP apps aren’t meant to be used in a specific way.<br>
    They’re meant to be there when something comes up.
</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Late at night</h2>
    <p>
        A student opens MindFlipOut because their thoughts won’t stop replaying.
        They don’t want a lecture, and they don’t want therapy language.
    </p>
    <p>
        They flip one thought, close the app, and breathe.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>During a break</h2>
    <p>
        A parent installs MindShoutOut during a lunch break.
        Later that day, a reminder arrives — not advice, just a sentence they wrote earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
        It lands quietly. They keep going.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>In a moment of exhaustion</h2>
    <p>
        Someone opens MindZoneOut and looks at a blank screen for thirty seconds.
        No music. No guidance. No performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just space.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>On the way out the door</h2>
    <p>
        A short reminder appears at the edge of the day.
        Not because something is wrong — just because it mattered once.
    </p>
    <p>
        The thought is acknowledged, and the day continues.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Between tasks</h2>
    <p>
        A thought appears that doesn’t need solving — just answering.
        It’s written down, gently reframed, and left there.
    </p>
    <p>
        It doesn’t follow them into the next task.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    These aren’t routines or techniques.<br>
    They’re small moments where the mind is allowed to stop carrying something.
